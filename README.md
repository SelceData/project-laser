# Brawl Stars - Project Laser
<h4>This is restored version of Project Laser's game of Brawl Stars without redirecting to link.brawlstars.com</h4>

You can play this game even on PC using space and arrow keys as controls.

You'll need to install and setup a local server on your PC. I recommend XAMPP apache server for its simplicity.

First you'll need is to create new folder and move files there, then move it to htdocs folder in xampp directory.

Second, start apache server in XAMPP control app.

Third, open your browser and type: 127.0.0.1/[htdocs folder name]

For playing on your android or iOS device they need to be in the same local network with your computer. Usually its 192.168.1.100

<h4>Original game was written by Supercell and all rights is received.</h4>
